## Submitting Emails

1. Under **Select the submission type**, you can select **Email**, **URL**, and **Email Attachment**.
2. Add the email Network Message ID or upload the email file.
   - **Network Message ID (NMID)** is a unique identifier assigned to emails processed through Microsoft Defender for Office 365. The NMID can be used to trace and investigate specific email messages within the Defender portal.
   - To find the Network Message ID:
     - Open the email message in Outlook.
     - View the message header: In Outlook, go to **File > Properties**. The Internet headers box will contain the NMID.
     - Search the Defender Portal: Use the NMID to search for the specific email in the Microsoft Defender for Office 365 portal. Go to **Threat Explorer** or **Advanced Hunting** and enter the NMID to locate and investigate the email.
     - It is available as this value: **X-MS-Exchange-Organization-Network-Message-Id**.
     - If you're looking at a quarantined message, it will be **X-MS-Office365-Filtering-Correlation-Id**.
3. Choose at least one recipient who had an issue. It is recommended to add one user.
4. Specify why you are submitting this message to Microsoft:
   - **I've confirmed it's clean**.
   - **It appears clean**.
   - **It appears suspicious**.
   - **I've confirmed it's a threat** (you will have to select whether it's spam, phish, or malware).
5. Click on **Next** and **Submit**.
